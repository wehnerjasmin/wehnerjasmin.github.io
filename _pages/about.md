I am a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. I completed my PhD in Agricultural Economics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen as part of the Research Training Group 2654 Sustainable Food Systems. I am interested in agricultural methane emissions, technology adoption in the dairy sector, climate change adaptation policies, and food economics.

I enjoy designing surveys for dairy farmers and consumers, leveraging large scale administrative data, and data visualization.
