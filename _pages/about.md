I am a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. I completed my PhD in Agricultural Economics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen as part of the Research Training Group 2654 Sustainable Food Systems. I am interested in Carbon markets for agriculture, Climate change adaptation and mitigation policies, Agricultural Markets, and Food Security. 

Currently, we study the farm level drivers of the adoption of anaerobic digesters on dairy farms across 12 US states. In general, I enjoy to compile micro level datasets and to visualize data the most.
