I am a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. I completed my PhD in Agricultural Economics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen as part of the Research Training Group 2654 Sustainable Food Systems. I am interested in Carbon markets for agriculture, Methane emissioins, Climate change adaptation and mitigation policies, Agricultural Markets, and Food Security. 

Currently, we study the farm level drivers of the adoption of anaerobic digesters on dairy farms across twelve US states. I am passionate data visualization and discovering ways to combine datasets from several different sources.
