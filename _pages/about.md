I am a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. I completed my PhD in Agricultural Economics at the University of Göttingen as part of the Research Training Group 2654 Sustainable Food Systems. I am an applied economist with research interests in farm level agricultural adaptation to climate change, agricultural emissions, sustainable food systems, and data science. I conduct research in these fields by using traditional econometrics and machine learning techniques. I enjoy leveraging large scale administrative data as well as generating new data by surveying consumers and farmers online or in the field.
