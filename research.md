## Working Papers

1. **Farm level drivers of anaerobic digester installations on dairy farms across the US**  
   With Chris Wolf and Wendong Zhang. *Under review*.

     <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Anaerobic digesters (AD) on dairy farms are a promising methane emission reduction strategy, enabling farmers to convert manure into biogas for electricity or renewable natural gas (RNG) while generating carbon credits for environmentally friendly energy production. This study provides a farm-level, nationwide analysis of the key farm- and location-specific factors influencing AD adoption among medium and large dairy farms. Using a dataset of 2,976 geo-referenced farm-level observations from 12 U.S. states, we map existing AD installations and identify the drivers of adoption through a binary logit model. Our results indicate that the likelihood of installing an AD increases by up to 13.77 percentage points outside California and up to 39.01 percentage points within California for farms with more than 3,000 milk cows, compared to those with 200-1,000 milk cows. Between the years 2000 and 2015, the interaction between the farm size category between 1,000 and 2,000 cows and proximity to a gas pipeline seems to have influenced AD adoption. However, this combined association becomes less pronounced for installations occurring after 2016 when California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard took effect. These results suggest that current policies aimed at promoting AD adoption could be improved by tailoring incentives to different farm sizes.

     <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Existing measures of resilience focus on specific food system components, neglecting the complexity of the whole system. We propose a measure of resilience that encompasses three dimensions of a food system: economic profitability, environmental sustainability, and adequate nutrition. To empirically estimate the proposed model, we combine longitudinal household-level data from Malawi, Tanzania, and Nigeria with GIS data and macro-level indicators. We define resilience as a normative condition using a probabilistic moment-based approach following Cissé and Barrett (2018). To aggregate the probabilities across different dimensions into a single index of resilience, we employ and compare two different methods. Our findings indicate an overall increase in resilience of farming households over time, with improvements in Nigeria and Tanzania. Clear trade-offs are evident across the various domains of the food system. Both proposed resilience indexes demonstrate strong performance. They are correlated with improvements in income, vegetation, and dietary diversity, and they partially mitigate the effects of various shocks. The comparison between the two methods indicates a preference for the simpler PCA-based approach to measuring farmers’ resilience using a food system approach. Our findings underline the need to broaden our focus beyond individual aspects of resilience to achieve sustainable food systems.

     <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Global and open trade supports peace, economic prosperity and food security worldwide, but it is today subject to fluctuations that have roots in multi-dimensional factors. A number of developments currently threaten operating trade networks and have implications for food security: increasing conflicts along cereal trade routes, supply-chain disruptions due to Covid-19, increasing domination of China over the global trade of goods, fluctuating yields due to climate change, and high domestic inflation, in particular of food items, that affect exchange terms. Policy response is typically to impose restriction on exports (bans or quotas) and import (increasing tariffs) in order to isolate domestic economies, form fluctuation of the world economies (Abbott and Borot de Battisti, 2011). These are viewed as short-terms responses that tend to export a country’s own vulnerability, further adding volatility of global markets instead of stabilizing it. In order to respond to these challenges adequately, policy makers require an appreciation of the relative importance of these threats against each other. This paper first conceptualizes the 5C6C (Conflicts, Covid-19, China, Climate change, and Currency and inCome), the current features most susceptible to affect global trade of food products. Second, the paper combines a gravity model of trade with the machine learning LASSO technique to identify the features most relevant to trade flows of cereals in recent years. This paper contributes to the literature on trade system resilience and food security by looking jointly at several disrupting factors, rather than at single factors separately, in order to assess their relative influence on trade. Results indicate that climate change and high food prices have a more frequent association with trade flows, compared to more abrupt events such as COVID or conflicts. Finally, regional results show that African exports and imports are less tied to global fluctuations than other regions, probably due to lesser integration. The role of China in international trade is also a driving force, especially for Europe and Asian markets. Overall, predictors of trade vary across regions, crop and role as buyer or seller. The results can inform policy makers on the need to prioritize policy responses.

4. **Investigating market power in the German dairy industry**  
   With Jan-Henning Feil and Xiaohua Yu. *Available as discussion paper*.
   <details>
     <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Market power in economic theory refers to deviations from marginal cost pricing, causing unfair competition and welfare losses. In agri-food supply chains, market power by multiple actors contributes significantly to these losses. Dairy processors, as buyers in the raw milk market and sellers in the output market, have received limited attention. Using 323 observations from German dairy processors (2010–2021), we find processors exploit their position, buying milk 9.2 percent below marginal value and selling processed milk 1.1 percent above marginal cost. To reduce welfare losses, we recommend continuous monitoring by federal authorities, considering processors’ dual roles in market power analyses.

5. **Drivers of the Global Thirst for Milk**  
   With Xiaohua Yu. *Available as discussion paper*.

     <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Climate change mitigation efforts face increasing demand for animal source food consumption and dairy in particular. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the differences in dairy consumption levels and underlying drivers on a global scale. We attempt to estimate drivers of milk consumption by using a panel regression clustering approach and analyzing the relative importance by applying a Shorrocks-Shapley decomposition of the R-squared. Further, we show how the results change when we incorporate income projections for the years 2050 and 2100. Results suggest that, using a panel data set from 2000 to 2020 for 120 countries, socio-economic milk consumption drivers can be allocated to six different clusters with price elasticities ranging from -1.085 to 0.450 and income elasticities from -0.527 and 1.084. Decomposing the R-squared shows that the value of milk industry seems to explain most of the variance of milk consumption. When considering income projections until the mid and end century, we find that the share of young population gains statistical significance. Future research should investigate how fiscal climate change adaptation policies could be designed effectively while considering heterogeneous milk demand drivers.
