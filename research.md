1. **Farm level drivers of anaerobic digester installations on dairy farms across the US**  
   With Chris Wolf and Wendong Zhang. *Under review*.

     <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Anaerobic digesters (AD) on dairy farms are a promising methane emission reduction strategy, enabling farmers to convert manure into biogas for electricity or renewable natural gas (RNG) while generating carbon credits for environmentally friendly energy production. This study provides a farm-level, nationwide analysis of the key farm- and location-specific factors influencing AD adoption among medium and large dairy farms. Using a dataset of 2,976 geo-referenced farm-level observations from 12 U.S. states, we map existing AD installations and identify the drivers of adoption through a binary logit model. Our results indicate that the likelihood of installing an AD increases by up to 13.77 percentage points outside California and up to 39.01 percentage points within California for farms with more than 3,000 milk cows, compared to those with 200-1,000 milk cows. Between the years 2000 and 2015, the interaction between the farm size category between 1,000 and 2,000 cows and proximity to a gas pipeline seems to have influenced AD adoption. However, this combined association becomes less pronounced for installations occurring after 2016 when California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard took effect. These results suggest that current policies aimed at promoting AD adoption could be improved by tailoring incentives to different farm sizes.

2. **Investigating market power in the German dairy industry**  
   With Jan-Henning Feil and Xiaohua Yu. *Available as discussion paper*.

     <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Market power in economic theory refers to deviations from marginal cost pricing, causing unfair competition and welfare losses. In agri-food supply chains, market power by multiple actors contributes significantly to these losses. Dairy processors, as buyers in the raw milk market and sellers in the output market, have received limited attention. Using 323 observations from German dairy processors (2010–2021), we find processors exploit their position, buying milk 9.2 percent below marginal value and selling processed milk 1.1 percent above marginal cost. To reduce welfare losses, we recommend continuous monitoring by federal authorities, considering processors’ dual roles in market power analyses.

3. **Drivers of the Global Thirst for Milk**  
   With Xiaohua Yu. *Available as discussion paper*.

     <summary>Abstract</summary>
     Climate change mitigation efforts face increasing demand for animal source food consumption and dairy in particular. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the differences in dairy consumption levels and underlying drivers on a global scale. We attempt to estimate drivers of milk consumption by using a panel regression clustering approach and analyzing the relative importance by applying a Shorrocks-Shapley decomposition of the R-squared. Further, we show how the results change when we incorporate income projections for the years 2050 and 2100. Results suggest that, using a panel data set from 2000 to 2020 for 120 countries, socio-economic milk consumption drivers can be allocated to six different clusters with price elasticities ranging from -1.085 to 0.450 and income elasticities from -0.527 and 1.084. Decomposing the R-squared shows that the value of milk industry seems to explain most of the variance of milk consumption. When considering income projections until the mid and end century, we find that the share of young population gains statistical significance. Future research should investigate how fiscal climate change adaptation policies could be designed effectively while considering heterogeneous milk demand drivers.
